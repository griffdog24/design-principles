     <h1>Emphasis</h1>
     <p>“The focal point can be anything really, as long as it remains the most eye-catching piece of visual information. Perhaps the focal point becomes so because it sits in a pool of negative space. Perhaps the curve of a line in the layout literally leads to the focal point.” (pp.53)</p>
    <p>The focal point is the most eye-catching part of the web page. It’s what the viewer first sees, when the website opens. Without a focal point, the reader doesn’t have something to follow.</p>

    <p>Burrus is the focal point of Virginia Tech's campus when walking on the drill field. Your eyes are immediately drawn to the building and its castle like features. Not only are you drawn to it, but you can see it from anywhere on the drill field, because it is a staple of the University.</p>
