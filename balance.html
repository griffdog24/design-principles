     <h1>Balance</h1>
     <p>“In design, we think of balance in terms of visual weight. You want your designs and layouts to be visually balanced, unless your communication purpose is to unsettle people by making them feel unbalanced and tense or anxious. There are three kinds of visual balance: radial, symmetrical and asymmetrical.”(pp.56) </p>
    <p>Balance is two or more things that must be equal. An even distribution between objects to make something seem more appealing. It also creates a sense of completion.</p>

       <p>When lifting, you must make sure to keep the bar and your body balanced. Otherwise the weight will tilt and cause the bar to fall, which can hurt you or the surrounding students. It is an important part of excercise in general. You want to make sure you balance the different types of lifting you do as well as stay balanced in each excercise to make your own body healthier and better looking.</p>
